# Automatic Transmission Program
This is a simple automatic transmission controller for cars based on fuzzy logic created in C#. 

Users can adjust the sliders of the factors to produce a desired gear for the automatic transmission.

The factors include speed, throttle position, brake, steering wheel position, and throttle variation.

All of these variables will control and determine the optimal gear for an automatic transmission car.

## Disclaimer and Special Thanks: 

Big thanks to LucianoBAF of Github for the base repository.

This program is created and based on LucianoBAF's Fuzzy Automatic Transmission program.  

The source code was made to be integrated with the racing simulation game Assetto Corsa - this feature has been removed in this repository.
